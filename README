DESCRIPTION

Reversi42 is a complete implementation of the classic Reversi (Othello) board game 
written in Python. The game features:

- Full GUI implementation using Pygame
- AI opponent with configurable difficulty levels
- Multiple player types (Human, AI, Random)
- Complete game logic with move validation
- Alpha-beta pruning AI strategy
- ASCII and graphical board representation
- Game history tracking

GAME FEATURES

- 8x8 standard Reversi board
- Real-time move validation
- Visual indication of available moves
- Turn-based gameplay with automatic switching
- Win/loss detection and scoring

- Configurable AI depth (difficulty levels)

PLAYER TYPES

1. HumanPlayer: Interactive player using mouse clicks
2. AIPlayer: Intelligent AI using alpha-beta pruning
3. Monkey: Random move selection for testing

AI STRATEGY

The AI uses advanced techniques including:
- Alpha-beta pruning for efficient search
- Position evaluation based on mobility and corners
- Move ordering with priority matrix
- Depth-limited search with configurable levels

REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library for GUI

Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
