DESCRIPTION

Reversi42 is a complete implementation of the classic Reversi (Othello) board game 
written in Python. The game features:

- Full GUI implementation using Pygame
- AI opponent with configurable difficulty levels
- Multiple player types (Human, AI, Random)
- Complete game logic with move validation
- Alpha-beta pruning AI strategy
- ASCII and graphical board representation
- Game history tracking

GAME FEATURES

- 8x8 standard Reversi board
- Real-time move validation
- Visual indication of available moves
- Turn indicator in header (small yellow dot below active player)
- Turn-based gameplay with automatic switching
- Win/loss detection and scoring
- Save/Load functionality (XOT format)
- Configurable AI depth (difficulty levels)

PLAYER TYPES

The game features a metadata-driven player system. New player types can be
added easily by defining their metadata - the menu auto-generates options.

Available Players:
1. HumanPlayer: Interactive player using mouse clicks
2. AIPlayer: Intelligent AI using alpha-beta pruning (configurable difficulty 1-10)
3. AIPlayerBook: AI with opening book support - uses theory in early game, then minimax
4. HeuristicPlayer: Fast AI using simple heuristics without deep search
5. GreedyPlayer: Always chooses the move that captures the most pieces immediately
6. Monkey: Random move selection for testing

Disabled (development):
- NetworkPlayer: Play against remote opponents (not yet implemented)

See ADDING_PLAYERS.md for instructions on adding custom player types.

AI STRATEGY

The AI uses advanced techniques including:
- Alpha-beta pruning for efficient search
- Modular position evaluation system (pluggable evaluators)
- Move ordering with priority matrix
- Depth-limited search with configurable levels
- Transposition tables for position caching
- Opening book support (Trie-based, O(m) lookup)

EVALUATORS

The game features a modular evaluation system with multiple strategies:

1. StandardEvaluator: Original evaluation with mobility and corner control
2. SimpleEvaluator: Basic piece count for testing
3. AdvancedEvaluator: Weighted positions with dynamic game phase evaluation
4. GreedyEvaluator: Maximizes immediate piece count (short-sighted strategy)

Each evaluator can be combined with any AI engine, allowing for easy
experimentation and development of custom evaluation strategies

REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library for GUI

Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

INSTALLATION

From Source:
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install Pygame if not already installed
3. Run the game using one of the methods below

Pre-built Binaries:
- Windows: Download Reversi42.exe from releases
- Linux: Download and install .deb package
- macOS: Download and install .app or .dmg

Building from Source:
See BUILD.md for instructions on creating distributable packages

RUNNING THE GAME

Method 1 - Using the main entry point:
```bash
python3 reversi42
```

Method 2 - Using the module entry point:
```bash
python3 src/reversi42.py
```

Method 3 - As a module:
```bash
python3 -m src.reversi42
```

TOURNAMENT SYSTEM

Run automated AI vs AI tournaments with comprehensive statistics:
```bash
cd tournament
python3 tournament.py
```

Features:
- Round-robin format (all vs all)
- Detailed statistical analysis
- Timing for every move
- Comprehensive reports
- Multiple AI types and difficulty levels

See tournament/README.md for complete documentation.

GAME CONTROLS

- Mouse: Click on available moves to place pieces
- C key: Toggle cursor navigation mode
- Arrow keys: Move cursor (when in cursor mode)
- ENTER/SPACE: Select move at cursor
- ESC: Open pause menu (save/load/quit)
- Q: Quick exit (no pause menu)

PAUSE MENU (ESC during game)

- Resume Game: Continue playing
- Save Game: Save to XOT format
- Load Game: Load from saved game
- Return to Menu: Abandon game
- Exit Game: Quit application

SAVE/LOAD SYSTEM

Games are saved in XOT (eXtended Othello Transcript) format:
- Stored in saves/ directory
- Contains move history and board state
- Human-readable text format
- Compatible with analysis tools

OPENING BOOK

The game includes an opening book system for stronger early-game play:

- **Location**: Books/opening_book.txt
- **Format**: Simple text format with move sequences (e.g., "F5d6C3")
- **Structure**: Trie-based for O(m) lookup efficiency
- **Usage**: AIPlayerBook automatically consults the book
- **Theory**: Includes classic Reversi openings (Diagonal, Tiger, Buffalo, etc.)
- **Performance**: Book moves are nearly instant (<< 1ms)
- **Fallback**: Uses minimax engine when out of book

The opening book contains 57+ opening lines covering the most important
early-game sequences in Reversi theory.

See Books/README.md for details on adding custom openings.
