================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The tournament system allows running automated AI vs AI tournaments with
comprehensive statistical analysis. No graphics, maximum speed.

BASIC USAGE
-----------

1. INTERACTIVE MODE (Recommended for first use)
   
   $ python3 tournament.py
   
   You will be prompted to:
   - Choose number of players (2-10)
   - Select AI type for each player
   - Set difficulty levels
   - Choose games per matchup (1-20)
   
   The system will then:
   - Run all games automatically
   - Display progress in real-time
   - Generate comprehensive statistical report
   - Save report to timestamped file


2. QUICK TOURNAMENT (Pre-configured)
   
   $ python3 quick_tournament.py
   
   Runs a fast 4-player tournament:
   - Minimax-Standard-4
   - Minimax-Advanced-4
   - Minimax-Greedy-4
   - GreedyPlayer
   
   2 games per matchup = 24 total games
   Takes approximately 1-2 minutes

WHAT TO LOOK FOR
----------------

1. WIN RATE
   - Primary success metric
   - Above 50% = better than average
   - Consistent performance more valuable than lucky streaks

2. COLOR BALANCE
   - Good AI should perform similarly as Black and White
   - Large difference (>10%) suggests strategic weakness
   - Black typically has slight advantage in Reversi

3. TIMING ANALYSIS
   - Average move time shows thinking efficiency
   - Standard deviation shows consistency
   - Faster is better if win rate maintained

4. HEAD-TO-HEAD
   - Some matchups favor certain strategies
   - Minimax-Advanced often beats Greedy
   - Transitive property doesn't always hold

5. SCORE AVERAGES
   - Higher average score = more aggressive/successful
   - Lower scores may indicate defensive play
   - Context matters: winning by 1 or 30 still counts as 1 win


EXAMPLE TOURNAMENT CONFIGURATIONS
----------------------------------

COMPETITIVE TOURNAMENT (Strong AIs)
  4 players: Minimax depth 6-8, Standard/Advanced evaluators
  10 games per matchup
  Total: 120 games
  Duration: ~10-15 minutes

STRATEGY COMPARISON (Same depth, different evaluators)
  4 players: All Minimax depth 6, vary evaluators
  5 games per matchup
  Total: 60 games
  Duration: ~5-8 minutes

DIFFICULTY LADDER (Same evaluator, different depths)
  4 players: Minimax Standard, depths 4/6/8/10
  3 games per matchup
  Total: 36 games
  Duration: ~3-5 minutes

BASELINE TESTING (New AI vs established)
  3 players: Your new AI + 2 reference AIs
  10 games per matchup
  Total: 60 games
  Duration: ~5-10 minutes


TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
----------------------

1. Start Small
   - Begin with 3-4 players and 2-3 games per matchup
   - Verify everything works before large tournaments

2. Fair Comparisons
   - Compare same depth when testing evaluators
   - Compare same evaluator when testing depths
   - More games = more reliable statistics

3. Interpreting Results
   - Single games can be flukes
   - 10+ games per matchup for reliable data
   - Look at trends, not individual games

4. Performance Testing
   - Check timing stats to ensure reasonable speed
   - Depth 10 may be too slow for tournaments
   - Depth 4-6 good for quick iteration

5. Statistical Significance
   - Small win rate differences (<5%) may be noise
   - Large sample sizes increase confidence
   - Consider both win rate AND score averages
