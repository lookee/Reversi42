## 🔧 Technical Details

### Bitboard Implementation

**Direction Masks (Fixed):**
```python
DIRECTIONS = [
    (-8, 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00),  # North
    (-7, 0xFEFEFEFEFEFEFE00),  # NE  
    (1,  0x7F7F7F7F7F7F7F7F),  # East
    (9,  0x007F7F7F7F7F7F7F),  # SE
    (8,  0x00FFFFFFFFFFFFFF),  # South
    (7,  0x00FEFEFEFEFEFEFE),  # SW
    (-1, 0xFEFEFEFEFEFEFEFE),  # West
    (-9, 0xFEFEFEFEFEFEFE00),  # NW
]
```

**Shift Logic (Fixed):**
```python
# Before (WRONG - caused edge wrapping):
return (board << shift) & mask

# After (CORRECT - mask first):
return (board & mask) << shift
```

### Opening Book API

**New Methods:**
```python
# Find all openings for a specific move
openings = book.get_openings_for_move(history, move)
# Returns: List of opening names

# Example:
openings = book.get_openings_for_move("", Move(6, 5))
# Returns: ['Diagonal Opening', 'Tiger Opening', ... ] (57 total)
